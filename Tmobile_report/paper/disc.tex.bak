\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Future Work}
The current study is primarily focus on the latency improve over the RLC layer. It is also possible to measure the delay improvement over application layer directly, especially for the initial period of the data transmission. Another possible direction is to evaluation the energy efficiency for the improved RLC protocols with fast retransmission mechanism. Since QxDM provides device data transmission power information, we could also evaluate the energy saving over each RRC state and state transitions.

\subsection{Limitation}
Since we could not modify the handset's NIC (network interface card) driver, we only evaluate the
