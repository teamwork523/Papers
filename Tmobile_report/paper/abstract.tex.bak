% ABSTRACT

Slow network experience on smartphone could hurt user experience and downgrade application reputation. When users are urgent about specific information, the carried information size is small but the latency of the mobile network service is very sensitive. The discontinuous burst of short data transmission is the most common traffic pattern in the cellular network. But significant latency appears at the beginning part of the data transmission. In order to identify the root cause, I use diagnostic cross layer monitoring tool, QxDM (Qualcomm eXtensible Diagnostic Monitor), and found that inactive response to packet loss in the RLC (Radio Link Resource) leads to unnecessary timeout in the transport layer. I propose a RLC \textit{Fast Re-Tx (Retransmission)} mechanism to avoid sluggish reaction to packet loss, and further reduce the latency during the initial network connection. Based on our simulation results, the \textit{Fast Re-Tx} mechanism could reduce the latency by up to \textit{35.69\%} over initial network connection.
