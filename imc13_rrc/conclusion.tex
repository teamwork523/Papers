\section{conclusion}
In this paper, we have presented new techniques for detecting and analyzing RRC state behavior and performance.  We have created a tool suitable for automatically inferring RRC state machines on end-user devices without requiring expert knowledge to run. We have demonstrated that it is effective in understanding RRC state implementations and their performance characteristics and how these vary by carrier and device model.  We have also shown that this tool is effective at uncovering previously unknown anomalous behavior, in particular that related to state transitions.  Finally, we used RLC-level analysis and a novel cross-layer analysis technique to uncover some underlying causes of these unexpected phenomena, and show how they relate to RLC-layer \emph{transient states}.  We proposed RLC \emph{Fast Re-Tx} mechanism that reduces the RLC latency up to 35.69\% during FACH\_{}TRANSITION.
