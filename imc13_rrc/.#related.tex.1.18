\section{Related Work}

Previous work has been done on the power and performance characteristics of 3G RRC state machines~\cite{3g_rrc} as well as 4G LTE networks~\cite{4g_rrc, drx_analysis} and specific features of those networks such as DRX~\cite{drx}.  Work has also been done on exploring the implications on application performance of RRC state and inadequacies in how mobile applications deal with RRC state~\cite{aro}.  

We expand upon this work by implementing an RRC inference algorithm that can automatically infer RRC states without assuming a specific RRC state machine, allowing anomalous or unexpected behavior to be measured.  Another novel feature is that the algorithm is also robust to background noise and other activity on the phone, allowing it to be run on arbitrary end-user devices without requiring a controlled environment or expert knowledge by the user.  We perform a survey of RRC state machine  implementations in real carriers worldwide, and discover previously unknown flaws and anomalies in RRC state machine implementations.  We determine the effects on performance by collecting the fine grained RLC layer ground truth, and correlating it with upper layer behaviors. Work by Souders~\cite{souder} measures RRC state machines on client devices, but being a browser-based solution it is not able to account for background activity on the phone or varying network types, or measure performance data as accurately as our application does.

Other work has been done on optimizing the use of the cellular network based on 3G or 4G specific phenomena. RadioJockey~\cite{radiojockey} investigates how to effectively trigger fast dormancy based on network traffic patterns, and TailEnder~\cite{tailender} and work by Deng et al.~\cite{trafficaware} propose a method of scheduling data transfers to minimize energy consumption without impacting user-perceived performance.


The other previous study provides cross comparison analysis over the TCP and RLC protocols, and optimizes the default protocol parameters~\cite{opt.tcp.rlc}. Their primary goal is to improve the performance behavior by introducing TCP congestion control mechanism into RLC layer. However, their traces are purely generated from simulation software, which is less convincing compared with the authentic mobile network traffics. We collected traces from real-time cellular network traffic, and the identified performance issues are more realistic.

More generally, work has been done to measure performance characteristics of cellular networks and networks on mobile devices. The Livelab project~\cite{livelab} also makes use of users running a measurement app on their phones, and has among other things focused on measuring how users interact with mobile devices, and has explored measuring web usage in the wild~\cite{livelab-webusage}. Work by Halepovic et al.,~\cite{http_measure} presents a method of passively measuring HTTP transaction latency. Work by Gember et al.,~\cite{incontext} determines how to accurately measure user-perceived performance on user devices. JamLogger~\cite{jamlogger} is an ongoing project to collect general performance and user activity on mobile devices. Our work is complementary to these studies.

% Jamlogger: collects a variety of system statistics periodically in the background; does not have the same challenges as a system looking for specific data, both in measurement cost and in scheduling.  Mobiperf also is not concerned with covering location in the same way and does not have the same challenges.

% MEasure general real-world smartphone usage and wireless networks. Also uses interrupt-based logging, periodic logging, and collecting when idle.  Hitch-hike onto existing wakeups.  Vary frequency based on context.  More general measurements.  They don't describe power in detail, though - it's a short pape
