\subsection{QxDM Experiments}\label{sec:exp.setup}

% Describe what the tool does
QxDM is a real-time data collection and diagnostic logging tool for measuring mobile-based \textit{Radio Frequency} (RF) performance~\cite{qxdm_flyer}. It allows us to gain insight into lower layer RLC transmission information.  
%It is a Windows based monitoring application. When I perform control experiments and real application measurements, I plug in the device to the desktop or laptop with QxDM software installed. 
We used the tool to collect data on IP packets, RLC data PDUs, and RRC states, as well as RLC control PDUs and RLC configuration information such as polling timers and retransmission limits.  The experiments performed were done on two devices: a Galaxy S3 with Android OS 4.1.1 and HTC One S with Android OS 4.0.4, to observe any device dependent behavior. We plan to extend this analysis to more device types.
%Once the experiments finishes, I filtered out the real-time monitoring information related to IP packets, RLC PDUs (protocol data unit, the smallest data transmission unit in RLC layer), and RRC states in Table~\ref{tab:QxDM.logs}, and dump the results into a log file. The 0x11EB log entry includes IP headers, IP payloads, and its customized header. Since large IP packets will be fragmented into smaller segments, the customer header could indicate the segment index of the whole IP packet. The 0x4132 and 0x4133 unveil the RLC AM (acknowledge mode) configurations, i.e. the polling function timers, the retransmission limit for a single PDU, and etc. The 0x413B, and 0x418B provides RLC PDU header and first byte payload information for both data PDUs and control PDUs (or STATUS PDUs) in both uplink and downlink directions. We wrote a QxDM log parser to aggregate the filtered entries, and apply cross layer analysis to understand the correlation between different layers. I conduct all the experiments on two devices -- Galaxy S3 with Android OS 4.1.1 and HTC One S with Android OS 4.0.4, to observe any device dependent behavior.


%QxDM provides precise RRC state information to indicate the current radio channel state. RLC data PDU and status PDU will assist us in cross layer mapping to the transport layer data, i.e. TCP/UDP. Other context information could also be found in the log, i.e. signal strength and physical layer transmission bit rate. The QxDM log is essentially a list of log entries formatted as a uniformed header with timestamp, a detailed log entry description, and a raw hex dump result.

%\subsection{QxDM Experiments}\label{sec:ctrl.exp}

% UDP/ TCP control experiment set up

There were several phenomena that we wished to investigate in order to uncover the root causes of behavior observed at the UDP level. We wanted to verify the existence of unexpected latencies during transitions to FACH and identify the root cause of the problem.  To do so, we ran our RRC inference test for 160 consecutive hours and collected QxDM logs as well as server-side tcpdump~\cite{tcpdump} traces.
We labelled our UDP packets with a sequence number, and the echo server sent back the received sequence number.  We will refer to this dataset as the \emph{QxDM\_{}UDP\_{}Trace}.  

For a second set of tests, we sent a packet train of TCP packets of size 10 KB with inter-packet timings between 3s and 5s, incremented by 0.5 seconds.  These values were chosen as they fall within the range of inter-packet timings associated with unexpected FACH transition latencies and would allow us to investigate this unexpected behavior.  TCP contains its own \textit{automatic repeat request} (ARQ) mechanism and we wished to investigate the RLC retransmission delay's influence on TCP retransmission.  We will refer to this dataset as \emph{QxDM\_{}TCP\_{}Trace}.

%The purpose of the control experiments is to verify the unexpected delays over noisy FACH state, and identify the root cause of the problem. First, we repeated our active RRC inference test for 160+ hours and dump both the client QxDM and server side tcpdump traces to perform offline analysis~\cite{tcpdump}. 
%In order to distinguish the identities of each UDP packets, we manually injected a "sequence number" into the first four bytes of the sender's randomized payload, and the echo server sent back the received sequence number as acknowledge number in its payload. We will refer the trace as \emph{QxDM\_{}UDP\_{}Trace} in the later paragraph. Second, we designed a packet train probing using TCP packets so that we could recreate the "pseudo-state" issue~\cite{pkt.train}. Basically, we send a "train" of TCP packet size of 10 KB bytes with interleaving gap period of 3 seconds to 5 seconds incremented by 0.5 seconds with the total of 500 packets. The gap period is the DCH demotion timer period considering the variance in the lossy channel, and adjacent packet will transmit the packet starting from FACH state. Therefore, we will have more transition over the troublesome FACH state to allow us to take a closer look the root cause. Since TCP has its own ARQ (automatic repeat request) mechanism, it would be interesting to investigate the RLC retransmission's delay influence over TCP retransmission. We will refer the trace as \emph{QxDM\_{}TCP\_{}Trace} in the later paragraphs.

% UDP results
%\subsection{Verification Latency using QxDM}\label{sec:verify.latency}

% UDP loss behavior over different states
%QxDM provides the ground truth information about RRC state, so we want to validate the delay behavior based on the inferred RRC model. To verify the packet delay in the transport layer over each RRC state, we need to know the RRC state for transport layer packets and RLC layer PDUs. Since each RRC state log is only a single log entry indicating the change of RRC state, we don't have explicit RRC state information tied to each packet and PDU. Therefore, we determine the RRC states by backtracking the most recent RRC state log, then assign as attributes to the packets and PDUs so that we could acquire RRC state information directly from the packet or PDU itself. 

%Because the the promotion period for PCH and FACH differs from their initial period due to additional signaling overhead, we want to distinguish between a RRC state with and without involving transitions. Since we focus on the initial period of data transmission, the RRC state promotion is more meaningful than state demotion, which is the end of whole data transmission period. So RRC state promotion is our preliminary concern for this project. We break down the normal FACH into an initial FACH state and FACH to DCH promotion state, named as FACH\_{}INIT and FACH\_{}PROMOTE specifically. Similarly, PCH was divided into PCH\_{}INIT and PCH\_{}PROMOTE. Since the FACH promotion timer is on average 0.92 seconds and PCH promotion state is on average 0.21 seconds. We define the FACH\_{}PROMOTE state as the time slot of counting back 0.92 seconds from the point of promoting to DCH. For the same reason, PCH\_{}PROMOTE state describes the time slot of counting back 0.21 seconds from the point of promoting to FACH. 

%From the \emph{QxDM\_{}UDP\_{}Trace}, we calculate the UDP RTT by mapping the client transmitted UDP packets to the served echoed back packets through comparing the manually injected "sequence number". If both packets have the identical "sequence number" in their first four byte payload, then the RTT for the transmitted data is the timestamp difference between the two packets. Figure~\ref{fig:udp.rtt} shows the UDP RTT broken down into different RRC state and state transitions. The average RTT at FACH\_{}INIT state is \textit{2.52 s} for HTC One S and \textit{2.08 s} for Galaxy S3, which around both around \textit{190\%} greater than each one's RTT in DCH. The average RTT for FACH\_{}PROMOTE state is \textit{1.14 s} for HTC One S and \textit{1.05 s} for Galaxy S3, which are around \textit{40\%} greater than those in DCH. The result could validate the abnormal delay behavior especially during the initial part of the FACH state, namely the FACH\_{}INIT state. We could also observe a substantial latency over PCH\_{}PROMOTE state. Because packets cannot stay in PCH during the transmission, the promotion to FACH and DCH will double the signaling overhead, which introduces more latency.

\subsection{Cross Layer Data Analysis}\label{sec:cross.layer.algo}

% Describe the mapping algorithm we use for cross-layer analysis
If we could correlate the transport layer packets with the RLC layer transmitted PDUs, we will have a transparent view of link layer behaviors, especially RLC retransmission.  One of the fundamental limitations we need to address when using  QxDM to analyze data is that packets are only partially logged --- for example, only the header and first byte data payload are logged for each RLC PDU. It is also possible that a small fraction of RLC PDUs cannot be captured, which lead to a unnecessary sequence number gap. We created a mapping algorithm to handle all these limitations.

% The mapping algorithm here
The cross layer mapping algorithm creates a mapping between complete IP packets (also known as SDUs, or \textit{Service Data Units}) and the corresponding fragmented RLC payloads (or the PDUs).  Only the first data byte is captured by QxDM, which complicates matching PDUs to SDUs.  It is necessary to determine the end of the IP packet associated with each PDU as we iterate over the PDUs.  Unfortunately, each PDU can contain either payload data from a single SDU, or from two SDUs.  If an SDU does not fill a PDU then the RLC protocol will concatenate part of the next SDU to fill the rest of the space~\cite{spec-3G-RLC}, as a way to increase the transmission efficiency.  If the cumulative mapped index equals the size of the SDU (or the length of IP packets), we can claim to have successfully found a mapping; otherwise no mapping was discovered.\TReport{Algorithm~\ref{alg:cross.mapping} describes this mapping mechanism in detail.}

%is essentially a map between the complete IP packets (known as SDU) and corresponding fragmented RLC payload data bytes (known as PDU). Due to the partial logged information in QxDM, only the first data byte is captured in the log. Thus, we have to skip over the rest of the PDU, and try to match for the first data byte in the next PDU. The problem at this point is to determine the end of IP packets while we iterate through the consecutive RLC PDUs. Since each PDU could either contain the payload data dedicated to a single SDU or belongs to two SDUs. If the reminder size of the SDU cannot fulfill the largest size of PDU, then RLC protocol will concatenate the part of the next SDU to fill the rest of space~\cite{spec-3G-RLC}. Ultimately, if the accumulative mapped index equals the size of SDU, we claim to find a mapping successfully; otherwise no mapping discovered. Algorithm ~\ref{alg:cross.mapping} states the detailed information of the mapping mechanism.

% the corner case of the mapping algorithm
There is a corner case in the mapping algorithm where QxDM cannot capture some of the SDUs.  As in TCP, the sequence number for RLC DPUs can uniquely distinguish between PDUs.  If there are missing PDUs, then the first byte for each PDU cannot be mapped.  In that case, we can skip over missing PDUs and look for a match by making use of the fact that PDUs have a known size.  We look for matches occurring at multiples of the PDU size after the last match --- this is respesented by the ``factor" variable in the mapping algorithm.  However, this aggressive mapping mechanism where we leap over packets cannot recover all packets in this corner case. This is especially true when the missing PDUs are at the beginning or end of the mapped RLC list.  We evaluated the accuracy of this improved mapping algorithm by observing the percentage of mapped IP packets in both \emph{QxDM\_{}TCP\_{}Trace} and \emph{QxDM\_{}TCP\_{}Trace}. We found that we were on average able to correctly map 99.8\% of packets. 

%\mycomment{besides using mapping coverage as a metric for evaluation, what are other ways we can validate the correctness of the mapping? Answer: another way to validate the mapping is to map group of RLC PDU back to the TCP/UDP packets, but due to missed log information, we are not 100\% confidence in that direction.}

%There is a corner case in the mapping algorithm such that the QxDM cannot capture the some of the SDUs. Similar to TCP protocol, the sequence number in RLC PDUs could uniquely distinguish between every PDUs. If there are some missed PDUs, then we cannot map the first byte data for every PDU size. In that case, we could even skip over the missed PDUs and add up multiple of PDU size to hunt for a match, which is represented as "factor" variable in the mapping algorithm. However, the aggressive leap mapping mechanism cannot fully recover the corner case, especially when the missed PDUs were either the beginning or the end part of the mapped RLC list. We evaluate the improved mapping algorithm by checking the percentage of mapped IP packets in all the traces of control experiments, and the average mapping ratio is \textit{99.8\%}.

\subsection{RLC Retransmission Calculation}\label{sec:rlc.retx.cal}

The RLC layer includes a retransmission mechanism to improve the reliability of transmissions over the lossy data transmission channel.  However, this also causes delays, as upper layers are unaware of these retransmissions, especially for TCP retransmission timeout. We will describe how we determine when RLC retransmission has occurred from the QxDM logs.

%The RLC layer retransmission is a protection mechanism that maximize the reliability over a loss data transmission channel. However, it also causes the delays due to duplicate transmissions without noticing the upper layers. To assist further identifying the root cause of the latency, we first introduce how we calculate the RLC retransmission from the QxDM logs.

% how to calculate the RLC retransmission
Each RLC sequence number uniquely identifies subsequent RLC PDUs, so we can determine RLC retransmissions based on duplicate sequence numbers.  One complication, however, is that sequence numbers are reused cyclically every 4096 PDUs.  To avoid over-counting duplicate sequence numbers from a different cycle, a smaller window size of 512 PDUs is set to count how often sequence numbers reappear. Therefore, the number of RLC retransmission is the accumulative count of the repeated sequence number for a given list of RLC PDUs~\cite{spec-3G-RLC}.

% RLC retransmission Ratio calculation
RLC retransmission ratio is useful to represent the relative frequency of RLC retranmission over a certain period or range. It is defined as the the total number of retransmitted PDUs divided by the total number of PDUs in a domain. For example, the RRC state for each RLC PDU is determined by backtracking to the most recent RRC state log entry.  RLC-layer retransmitted PDU counts are broken down based on the RRC states where they were transmitted. By dividing the the total number of retransmitted PDUs by the total number of PDUs in each RRC state, the retransmission ratio can be calculated. We could also calculate the RLC layer retransmission ratio for a specific inter-packet time mentioned in \S\ref{sec:methodology} by setting the domain of calculation as a certain inter-packet time transmission period.

%The sequence number of the RLC PDU will uniquely identify each RLC packet. Therefore, we determine the RLC retransmission based on the duplicate of sequence numbers. Since the size of RLC PDU is only 42 bytes and is very limited, if the RLC keeps an effective throughput, it has to reduce the number of bits in the header to hold the sequence number. Therefore, the sequence number only consumes 12 bits (range of 0-4095) in the current RLC protocol~\cite{spec-3G-RLC}. As a result, sequence number is circularly reused every 4096 PDUs, and it is always increasing. To avoid over-count the duplicate sequence number in different cycle, we hard set a smaller window size of 512 to count the reappearing sequence number within that range. We determine the RRC state for each RLC PDU by backtracking to most recent RRC state log entry, and fetch the RRC state based on that log content. We break down RLC retransmitted PDUs based on their RRC states when they were transmitted, and we calculate the retransmission ratio through dividing total number of retransmitted PDUs per RRC state by the total number of PDUs in that RRC state.
