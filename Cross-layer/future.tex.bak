\subsection{User Study}
We would like to evaluate our real-time user feedback tool with main stream user interactive applications. One of the recent post suggested that the 53\% of the smartphone users listens to Internet radio~\cite{internet.radio}. There are two popular Internet radio applications: TuneIn~\cite{tunein} and Pandora~\cite{pandora}. We will conduct a user study to collect real-time feedback from users when they are listening to Internet radio. Then we could use the cross-layer mapping to identify the root causes for bad QoE periods.

\subsection{Comprehensive Analysis}
We would like to compare the performance across different network carriers and under various of network conditions. Utilizing the cross-layer mapping tool, we will have a better understanding of the implementation difference between carriers, and the trade-off of those design decisions. Previous studies suggested link quality and traffic load could affect cellular network performance~\cite{loadsense,bartendr}. We are also thinking that the actual implementation of lower layer protocol could also be a contributor. That requires to perform a comprehensive analysis on various network carriers and distinguished network conditions.
